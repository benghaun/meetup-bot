# meetup_bot
This is the source code for a chatbot hosted on Telegram. It allows users to create events for a group of people in a group chat, who will be sent invites in private chats. They will respond to invites and the list of attendees will be updated on the group chat as each member responds.

This bot is currently designed only for personal use.
